## My Interests

I have always been fascinated by the collaborative work between the Department of Medicine and Engineering. 
I am interested in learning big data analysis and it's applications in reducing burden of lung diseases around the world. I look forward to learning R through this course, so that it complements my plans later in terms. 

## WhatIF
Something that I'm always excited about is the next Marvel movie and want to share their next 5 year plans with y'all:
